## NBFPEG -Network Based Features to Predict Essential Genes across organisms.
This repository contains tools to perform `undersampling` and `leave-one-out`
validation. Please check the directories for individual details and refer the
`S1.pdf` for detailed overview of features.

All relevant data and features are available at [DATAHUB link](https://datahub.io/karthik1290/nbfpeg-data)
